# THIS IS A MULTIPLE PAGE WEBSITE

In this project, I created and designed multiple pages using Bootstrap 5.

The project served as an application of what I learned in a Bootstrap course from Udemy. Itâ€™s beneficial to practice what we've learned after each lesson.

Although the Udemy course uses Bootstrap 4, which is an older version, I utilized Bootstrap 5, the latest version, for this project.

The images I used for this project were retrieved from https://www.pexels.com/collections/just-nature-zlezwqr/. I also grabbed some images from the Bootstrap 4 Udemy course.

Overall, it was a good project, and I learned a lot, including how to use features such as cards, accordions, and collapsible elements.
