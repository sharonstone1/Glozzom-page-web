# THIS IS A MULTIPLE PAGE WEBSITE

In this project, I created and design multiple page with Bootstrap5.

The Project was made to apply the learning bootstrap course from Udemy. It is good after a lesson to practice what we learnt.

The bootstrap course from Udemy use Bootstrap 4 which a old version but on this project, I used bootstrap 5 which the last version.

The images, i used for this project were retrieved from https://www.pexels.com/collections/just-nature-zlezwqr/ .

I also grapped some images from the bootstrap 4 udemy course.

It was a Good project, I learnt a lot through this project such as CARD, ACCORDION, COLLAPSE features etc.
